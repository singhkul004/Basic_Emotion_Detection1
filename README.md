# Basic_Emotion_Detection1
My first project being epxosed to Computer Vision and ML, is used to create a simple emotion tracking softwre that can distinguish between 5 
different emotions (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Surprise, Anger).
Accomplished by training preset model on AffectNet dataset and utilizing HaarCascase for face detection.

Advanced version of this project was implemented to create VR environment that transformed with user displayed emotions.
