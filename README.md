# Basic_Emotion_Detection1
This code is used to create a simple emotion tracking softwre that can distinguish between 5 
different emotions (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Surprise, Anger).
Accomplished by implementing preset models and algorithms such as the haar cascasde model 
that uses machine learning through tensorflow and keras, to process the data of facial recognition
in open computer vision.

Currently developing advanced version of this as well as implementation software #comingsoon
